Continue working on current project but keep in mind this idea:

Make User friendly way to edit the rc.xml file and make macros or mouse bindings,
along with the other features if feasible. Essentially recreating the ObConfig.

Could expand to edit other files such as the aliasedit and future discoveries. (also chron/chrontab)

Just don't let it make and receive emails though. =P
